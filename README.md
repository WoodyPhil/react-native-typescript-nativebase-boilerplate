## Instructions for use

1. This template was built in September 2017. Please check before using if the React Native Development has changed a lot.
2. Check out the [React Native documenation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [NativeBase documenation](https://docs.nativebase.io/) to understand and modify the default settings.
3. Before you start coding, I recommend that you check the tslint settings and adjust them to your code style if necessary.
